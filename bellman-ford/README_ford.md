# Bellman-Ford
The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph. In our project it's possible to select the source and the destination vertex. (built up using adjacency matrix concept)

## Input format
```
[total of vertex] [start vertex]

    [ADJACENCY MATRIX - size totalVertex^2]

[end vertex]

All integers!
```
Two integers, typed side by side, representing total number of vertex and the source vertex respectively (WATCH OUT! The first vertex must be 0, the second is 1 and so on...). In sequence, type your adjacency matrix where each weight will be in one line. Finally, the last number must be the destination vertex. You can see a sample in ford.input.
